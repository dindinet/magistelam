## Office Productivity - More Productive in the Cloud

### Simplicify your Business IT
Use G Suite from Google for business email, video conferencing, cloud storage and file sharing. Get all the tools that your team needs to collaborate, be more productive and reduce the management burden.

### Move to the Cloud
In case you hadn't already heard, using the Cloud for your IT pays for itself from day one.
* Reduced Capital Costs - No specialised hardware or software required
* Significant savings in support costs
* Secure (ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, PCI DSS)
* 99.9% uptime
* Improvements are continually rolling out by Google



### Business Benefits
#### Ease of Use
Set up new team members in minutes. 
Many people have experience with Google’s free offering (GMail, Docs, Drive etc.) so users transition to GSuite very smoothly. For others who are not so familiar, resources are available. The online *G Suite Learning Centre* helps users get the most out of G Suite with training guides, tips, customer examples and other resources, all of which minimises calls to your support team. 

Easily open and edit common file formats such as Microsoft® Word, Excel and PowerPoint. You can also export and share files with people who don’t use G Suite. The admin for your domain controls what users have access to what tools.

Industry-leading spam filters keep junk out of your inbox.
#### Affordable
From just £3.30 per month per user you can be up and running with a suite of business class productivity tools. Ease of use reduces support costs. G Suite stays up to date automatically, so you won't have to worry about software updates or security patches.
#### Available
To communicate with your team and your customers all you need is a device with access to the internet and your G Suite login. Google's ultra-reliable servers guarantee 99.9% uptime on your business email. 

Work from anywhere. Collaborate on documents, spreadsheets and presentations across devices. Real-time co-editing helps you get to the final version faster.
Log off from your office computer and pick up where you left off on your way home. Later, you can log on from home and once again pick up where you left off. All your messages and data are saved and backed up in the Cloud. 

Fire at the office, no problem. Drop your laptop out of the company helicopter as you fly over a lake, no problem. Once you get a new device and log into your account, everything will be just how you left it. 

#### Reliable
Google's ultra-reliable servers guarantee 99.9% uptime on your business email. Industry-leading spam filters keep junk out of your inbox. Keep all your work in one secure place with cloud storage. Access and share with teammates whenever you need to, from your computer, phone or tablet.
#### Secure
Keep all your company data safe and protected even in the event of lost or stolen devices and employee turnover.
Have your smart phone stolen at a bar, no problem. Leave your tablet on a train, no problem. All your documents and data are safely stored in the Cloud. To prevent data loss, you can log into your admin account and wipe clean your lost or stolen devices.
