## Office Productivity - IT in the Cloud

### Simplicify your Business IT
Use G Suite for business email, video conferencing, cloud storage and file sharing. Get all the tools that your team needs to collaborate, be more productive and reduce the management burden.

### Move to the Cloud
In case you hadn't already heard, using the Cloud for your IT pays for itself from day one.
* Reduced Capital Costs - No specialised hardware or software required
* Significant savings in support costs
* Secure (ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, PCI DSS)
* 
* Improvements are continually rolling out by Google

### Ease of Use
Many people have experience with Google’s free offering (GMail, Docs, Drive etc.) so users transition to GSuite very easy. For others who are not so familiar, resources are available. The online *G Suite Learning Centre* helps users get the most out of G Suite with training guides, tips, customer examples and other resources, all of which minimises calls to your support team.
