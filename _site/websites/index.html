<h3 id="a-scientific-approach-to-web-design">A Scientific Approach to Web Design</h3>

<p>A successful website focuses on converting visitors into customers/followers/subscribers. The right visitors convert when they can quickly find what they came looking for and can clearly see the offer is right for them. Increasing conversions moves you towards dominating your market or niche. The sooner you launch your website the sooner you will discover what changes you need to make to convert more visitors. By testing different versions of your pages on your live website you enlist your audience and real data to direct your success. When it comes to proving what will work data always beats gut feeling.</p>

<p>Fortunately a scientific approach to website design is better for your budget. Traditional ‘Design led’ website development is far from scientific and is often ‘reasuringly’ expensive. Until a website is launched we have no idea how it will be received by the intended target audience. If you are lucky enough to have a totally unique offering then just about any website will be successful even if it annoys the intended audience, chances are they will accept a poor experience and still convert.</p>

<p>Most organisations do not have an offer that is so compelling that they can insult the intelligence of their visitors. Most organistions have competition. Competition from organisations marketing a similar product or service as well as competition from other areas of life that seem to require more and more of our valuable finite attention.</p>

<p>If you are interested in owning a website that is measurably more cost effective and helps you grow your organisation then we want to talk to you.</p>

<p>With a scientific website you will launch sooner for less money. It will be easier, cheaper to ammend. As soon as you start testing you will start to see improvement in conversion. Improved conversion leads to an increase in revenue. An increase in revenue allows you to outbid your competitors to promote your website and dominate your market. Or you could take the safe route and spend a ton of money on a ‘beautiful’ all singing all dancing website that your friends and boss love as well as keeping your web designers busy and rich.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-spend-a-ton-of-money-and-have-your-website-fail">How to spend a ton of money and have your website fail.</h3>
<p>Enlist a trendy design team to build you a website featuring all the latest design trends and interface widgets. The result might look wonderful. Designer websites take longer to build. Take more time to modify. They load more slowly because they require more code and images to download before thay can displey as intended. Complex designs require more effort to have them work on all screen sizes. This design process eats up most of the budget so their is little to spend on testing on the intended audience. When you test designs on a live audience they invariably reject all things that get in the way of performing the task they came to perform. I advise website owners to launch a minimal viable website and test all design ideas thoroughly and only implement if the data confirms that the change improves the success of the page.</p>
