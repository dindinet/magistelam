<h3 id="a-scientific-approach-to-better-web-results">A Scientific Approach to better Web Results</h3>

<p>A successful website focuses on converting visitors into customers/followers/subscribers. The right visitors convert when they can <em>quickly</em> find what they came looking for and can <em>clearly</em> see the offer is right for them.</p>

<p><button onclick="document.getElementById('CTA').style.display='block'" class="w3-button w3-orange w3-center">Discuss your web project with an expert</button></p>

<p>Increasing conversions moves you towards dominating your market or niche. The sooner you launch your website the sooner you will discover what changes you need to make to convert more visitors. By testing different versions of your pages on your live website, you enlist your audience and real data to direct your success. When it comes to proving what will accelerate or what will put the brakes on your success, real data always beats gut feeling.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a scientific approach to website design is better for your budget. Traditional ‘Design led’ website development is far from scientific and is often ‘reasuringly’ expensive.</p>

<p>Until a website is launched, we have no idea how it will be received by the intended target audience. If you are lucky enough to have a totally unique offering then just about any website will be successful, even if it annoys the intended audience. Chances are they will accept a poor experience and still convert.</p>

<p>Most organisations do not have an offer that is so compelling that they can insult the intelligence of their visitors. Most organistions have competition. Not only will you have competition from organisations marketing a similar product or service but also competition from other areas of life that increasingly require more of our valuable finite attention.</p>

<p>If you are interested in owning a website that is measurably more cost effective and helps you grow your organisation, then we want to talk to you.</p>

<p>With a scientific website you will launch sooner for less money. It will be easier and cheaper to ammend. As soon as you start testing you will start to see improvement in conversion. Improved conversion leads to an increase in revenue. An increase in revenue allows you to outbid your competitors to promote your website and dominate your market. Or you could take the safe route and spend a ton of money on a ‘beautiful’ all singing all dancing website that your friends and boss love, as well as keeping your web designers busy and rich.</p>

<h3 id="please-dont-spend-a-ton-of-money-just-to-watch-your-website-fail">Please don’t spend a ton of money just to watch your website fail</h3>
<p>Many organisations enlist a trendy design team to build a website featuring all the latest design trends and interface widgets. The result will likely look wonderful. However, there are some downsides. Designer websites take longer to build. Take more time and effort to modify. They load more slowly because they require more code and images to download before thay can display as intended. Complex designs require more effort to work on all screen sizes and devices.</p>

<p>This design process eats up a large chunk of the budget so their is little to spend on testing with the intended audience. When you test designs on a live audience, they invariably reject all things that get in the way of performing the task they came to perform. That is, they are likely to reject a large part of your expensive design. Your budget is more effective when you adopt a scientific approach.</p>

<p>I advise clients to launch a Minimal Viable Website and test all design ideas thoroughly and only implement a change if the data confirms that the change improves the success of the page.</p>

<h3 id="the-minimum-viable-website">The Minimum Viable Website</h3>
<p>A Minimum Viable Website (MVW) is one that includes all the essentials required to communicate your offer to the intended audience. It should be SEO ready and fast loading. Once you have an MVW up and running you can start to test new features, alternative copy or content layouts. If your new change is a clear winner over the old you will implement. If it fails to move your website visitors then at least you know to focus your efforts elsewhere.</p>

<p>Not all your experiments will win over the existing element, neither will all your experiments result in clear winners. When a winner is not clear then you need to go back to the drawing board and probably ask a different question.</p>

<p><em>The scientific approach to web design is appropriate for all websites and for any organisation in any sector of the economy.</em></p>
