## Websites and Web apps
### A Scientific Approach to Web Design

A successful website is one that converts visitors into customers/followers/subscribers. Visitors convert when they quickly find what they came looking for and are persuaded by your copy to do so. Your job as website owner is to uncover the needed subtle changes to your pages that convert more visitors more often. The more visitors you convert the more you will come to dominate your market. The only way to do this is by testing different versions of your pages on your live website. Your audience will direct your success.

Fortunately a scientific approach to website design is better for your budget. Traditional 'Design led' website development is far from scientific and is often 'reasuringly' expensive. Until a website is launched we have no idea how it will be received by the intended target audience. If you are lucky enough to have a totally unique offering then just about any website will be successful even if it annoys the intended audience, chances are they will accept a poor experience and still convert.

Most organisations do not have an offer that is so compelling that they can insult the intelligence of their visitors. Most organistions have competition. Competition from organisations marketing a similar product or service as well as competition from other areas of life that seem to require more and more of our valuable finite attention. 

If you are interested in owning a website that is measurably more cost effective and helps you grow your organisation then we want to talk to you.

With a scientific website you will launch sooner for less money. It will be easier, cheaper to ammend. As soon as you start testing you will start to see improvement in conversion. Improved conversion leads to an increase in revenue. An increase in revenue allows you to outbid your competitors to promote your website and dominate your market. Or you could take the safe route and spend a ton of money on a 'beautiful' all singing all dancing website that your friends and boss love as well as keeping your web designers busy and rich.
