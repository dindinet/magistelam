<div class="w3-row"><div class="w3-col l9"><h2>Tune your website for higher conversion</h2><h3>Don't drive your visitors into the waiting arms of your competitors</h3><p>If your website is slow to load and does not dispay well on your visitors devices, especially smart phones, you need to fix the problems as soon as possible. People dislike slow loading websites. If you make people wait, they will abandon their visit and probably go directly to one of your competitors. Search engines want to serve the best possible results to their visitors. Search engines do not favour slow loading sites. Equaly, if your website is difficult to navigate or does not display optimally on visitors preferred devices, they will bounce. Search engines do not reward high bounce rate.</p><p ><a href="/website-tuning/">Learn more about tuning your website and reducing visitor bounce rate</a>(tune headers, footers, contact, faq to be always closing)</p></div></div>
