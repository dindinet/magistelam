    Getting traffic to your website is not getting easier or cheaper. It is important to engage and convert as many visitors as possible to get the best return on your investment of time and money. Your website can be improved to convert more visitors from the same traffic. If you pay for traffic then you should move heaven and earth to improve your conversion rate. When you make the breakthrough the effect on your organisation is transformational.

    <h2>Prepare your website for higher conversion</h2>
    <h3>Don't drive your visitors into the waiting arms of your competitors</h3>
    <p>If your website is slow to load or does not display well on all screen sizes, especially smart phones,  you need to make some changes. People dislike slow loading websites. If you make people wait they will abandon their visit and probably go directly to one of your visitors. Search engines want to serve the best possible results to their visitors. Search engines do not favour slow loading sites. Equaly if your website is difficult to navigate or does not display optimally on visitors preferred devices they will bounce. Search angines do not reward high bounce rate.</p>

Before you can start to optimise your website you need to be able to measure performance using analytics as well as using testing software to launch experiments of potential improvements.

Setting up an analytics tool and learning how to use it is essential for anyone who is serious about optimising their website for better results. Without analytics and testing tools website optimisation is impossible.

I recommend the use of Google Analytics and Google Optimize. These tools are free to use and as they are both from google they interate really well.
