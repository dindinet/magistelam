Before you can start to optimise your website you need to be able to measure performance using analytics as well as using testing software to launch experiments of potential improvements.

Setting up an analytics tool and learning how to use it is essential for anyone who is serious about optimising their website for better results. Without analytics and testing tools website optimisation is impossible.

I recommend the use of Google Analytics and Google Optimize. These tools are free to use and as they are both from google they interate really well.
