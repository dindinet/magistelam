## Page Load Speed can make or break your organisation

Page load speed can send your organisation’s growth into the stratosphere or bring it crashing down to earth without a sound.

People hate slow loading pages. Search engines (google) know this and promote faster pages to keep *their* users coming back.

Slow pages struggle to get effective listings in the search engines, especially in crowded competitive niches. Slow loading pages limit your organisation’s chances of succeeding even before a visitor lands on your website. Just like olympic sprinters do not choose to compete wearing work boots, a modern business should not try to compete in the digital space with an unoptimised website.

### Slow Loading Pages Increase the Chance of High Bounce Rate.

High bounce rate means large numbers of your visitors are leaving without even seeing your offer. High Bounce Rate is not your friend.

Some large organisations have crunched the numbers.

Results indicate that slow loading puts big dents in your bottom line whereas fast gets the profits gushing in.

While your website might not get the same number of visits or make as much money as Amazon or Walmart, it gets visitors nonetheless. Do all those visitors convert? How many of them bounce without seeing your content?

If your page takes too long to load people bounce simply because the delay allows their mind to wander or they just gave up in frustration.

What would you do if your sales team let the phone ring unanswered? What would you do if your sales team escorted potential clients off the sales floor? Or worse still, how would you feel if your salesman gave the details of your competitors to every caller or visitor?

Your web pages might just be committing all of these crimes. You need to check your page load times as soon as possible. Anything over 2 seconds is too slow.

https://www.bitcatcha.com/ is useful for websites that have a worldwide audience as it tells you how fast your site responds to visitors from around the world.

If your website visitors come from search result pages and they bounce straight back, they will bounce back to the other links in those result pages, your competitors.  

When a visitor bounces not only have you lost a potential sale/sign up, but you also wasted the budget and effort spent to get the visitor to you page in the first place.  

On the internet your web pages are the sales force. A high bounce rate is a signal that your online sales force is in trouble. They can't t repair themselves. Your online sales force need help.

It may well be more than just load speed that is causing the bounce but improving load speed is an essential first step. If you fail to fix page load speed issues, you are potentially sabotaging all your efforts to convert visitors.
