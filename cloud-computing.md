## Computing in the Cloud

### All the power you need when you need it

You may have heard the phrase: 

"Every company is a tech company now".

 It doesn't mean that every company is selling technology but rather every company needs to invest in technology to stay in touch with their customers, suppliers, staff and even their competitors.

Just consider how often you use technology to manage your private life. To buy things, to research purchases, to pay your taxes, to manage your fianaces... The list goes on and on. 

You probably make a concious choice to do business with organisations that have embraced technology to make life easier for their customers.

The advantages of Cloud Computing make it irresistable to smaller and newer companies as well as more established companies that already invest in IT.

The obvious reason to choose the Cloud, over owning physical hardware, is that your organisation will no longer need to make large capital investments in computing hardware. With the removal of hardware from your organisation, the cost of IT management is also slashed as the Cloud provider maintains the hardware and ensures that the software running is patched and up-to-date.

Startups and smaller companies can now access computing power that they could only dream of before Cloud Computing was a thing. 

Cloud Computing providers offer computing power as a service where you only pay for what you use. In many cases, computing resources are scaled up and down automatically to meet demand.

### What is Cloud Computing?

#### Infrastructure as a Service - IAAS

#### Platform as a Service - PAAS
Google App Engine, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Apache Stratos, OpenShift, AWS Elastic Beanstalk 

#### Software as a Service - SAAS
Software as a service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. Examples include GSuite, Office365, Google Analytics, Mailchimp

Software as a Service, also known as cloud application services, represent the most commonly utilized option for businesses in the cloud market. SaaS utilizes the internet to deliver applications to its users, which are managed by a third-party vendor. A majority of SaaS applications are run directly through the web browser, and do not require any downloads or installations on the client side.
